## Study Overview

## Lineages Overview



$~$
$~$

Several well-defined RABV clades circulate globally, within two major phylogenetic groups; bat-related and dog-related. The dog-related group is split into 6 different clades according to Troupin et al. (2016). These clades are: Africa 2, Africa 3, Cosmopolitan, Arctic, Asian and Indian. The majority of Nigerian sequences fall within the Africa 2 clade.


$~$

The MAD DOG (Method for Assignment, Definition and Designation Of Global lineages) tool is an updated lineage designation and assignment tool for rabies virus based on the dynamic nomenclature used for SARS-CoV-2 by Rambaut et al. (2020). This tool defines sequences beyond the clade and subclade level, allowing increased definition. Application of this tool can be used to generate detailed information to inform control efforts and monitor progress towards the elimination of rabies virus.

$~$

Details of the tool can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5503916

Overall 3 lineages have been detected in this study. 1 lineages are included here that have not been seen in this study, but are direct parents of lineages in this study, so are included for relevant evolutionary investigations.There are  3  existing lineages relevant to this study.
